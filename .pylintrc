# The `disable-many-arguments` error is displayed when a function has too many
# arguments (more then 5). This is not feasible for the ResourceManager right
# now, since it needs to recieve the objects to Create, Retrieve, Update and
# delete resources. We disable it for that specific reason.
#
# The `too-few-public-methods` error is displayed when a classes have too
# little public methods.. We disabled this bacause this triggers errors on
# bases classes that are only there as way to define a standard initiator.
#
# The `too-many-instance-attributes` error is displayed when a class has too
# many instance attributes. We disabled this because this triggers errors on
# after adding logging.
