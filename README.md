# My - Data

This repository contains the code to work with the database of the __My Project__. This library uses the [My model](https://github.com/DarylStark/my_model/issues) package to define the database models. It uses SQLModel to talk to the databas.

Basic instructions on how to use this library are in the __docs__ folder.
